The app has a number of modes which serve different purpose depending on the object. The app is based on the concept of Active vs Passive objects. \r\n\r\nBy default all objects are passive objects which can be tagged with text,images or sound. A different user running the same app can view the tagged media when the same object is detected.\r\n\r\nAn active object is any object that can communicate back with the app so that it can be remotely triggered. For example an arduino can be triggered for controlling the sensors attached to it like LEDs, speakers , servos etc. \r\n\r\nThe user can also connect multiple objects using gestures or set rules to trigger certain objects according to the state of another object. \r\nFor example, two speakers are connected using hand gestures to play the same audio on both speakers.\r\nor a rule is set to dim the lights when the song is played. The possibilities are endless only limited by the active objects connected with your app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSlit app is based on ofxQCAR which is Qualcomm's AR addon for openframeworks made possible by https://github.com/julapy/ofxQCAR\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/43212031@N06/11166614194/\" title=\"ipad2Trigger by Adarshk09, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5550/11166614194_5266ca6426_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"ipad2Trigger\"></a>\r\n\r\n## The app has the following modes:\r\n\r\nTag mode which is used to tag objects with images,sound or text\r\nTrigger mode which is used for triggering an Arduino\r\nTuck mode which is used for playing multiplayer games present in the same physical space\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/43212031@N06/11166554105/\" title=\"ipad2Tag2 by Adarshk09, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7442/11166554105_e0c1fe30fd_z.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" alt=\"ipad2Tag2\"></a>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
